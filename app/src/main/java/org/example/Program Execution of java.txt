 1. Request Flow
   - Client sends an HTTP request to the server
   - The request is handled by a controller
   - The controller calls a service to process the request
   - The service interacts with a repository to fetch or store data
   - The repository communicates with the database to execute queries
   - Finally, the response is sent back through the controller to the client
HTTP Request → Controller → Service → Repository → Database


2. Authentication Flow
   - Client sends authentication credentials (e.g., username and password)
   - The request is handled by the AuthController
   - The AuthController calls the AuthService to validate credentials
   - The AuthService interacts with the UserRepository to check user details
   - If valid, a token is generated and sent back to the client
   - The flow can be represented as:
Client → AuthController → AuthService → UserRepository → Database

3. Data Flow
    - Request DTOs from `/request` are used to receive data from clients
    - This data is processed by services
    -Services use repositories to interact with database
    - Response DTOs from `/response` are used to send data back to clients
